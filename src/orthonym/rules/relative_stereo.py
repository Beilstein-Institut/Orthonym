"""cis/trans names for ring pairs at the best-effort tier.

A ring pair that the Blue Book names with lowercase ``r``/``s`` descriptors has a second,
general name with ``cis`` or ``trans`` in front:

    (1r,4r)-cyclohexane-1,4-diol (PIN) trans-cyclohexane-1,4-diol (the Blue Book)
    bis[(1r,4r)-4-methylcyclohexyl]phosphane (PIN)
                                         bis(trans-4-methylcyclohexyl)phosphane (:48117)

 "Achiral cyclic compounds" (``:48103``) gives the lowercase descriptors the PIN
status; ``### Relative configuration: the stereodescriptors 'cis' and 'trans'``
(``:48155``) gives the general name: "When one ligand and one hydrogen atom are attached at each
of two positions of a monocycle, the steric relation (the relative configuration) of the two
ligands is expressed as 'cis' or 'trans', followed by a hyphen and placed before the name of the
compound. No locants are required before the stereodescriptors."

The best-effort tier ships only a name that OPSIN reads back to the input's full InChIKey, and
OPSIN reads no lowercase ``r``/``s``, so the strict path's name is withdrawn there. This module
turns such a withdrawn name into the general name. It works from what the descriptor check
accepted (``validation.stereo_descriptors.stereo_block_units``: the span of each descriptor block,
its multiplicity and the stereo units the reading binds to it), never from a locant read out of the string, and the
caller audits every candidate: the completeness predicates below, then the full-key round trip.

``note_withdrawn_name``/``withdrawn_names`` are the slot that hands the withdrawn names from the
validity gate to the offer builder,:func:`append_relative_stereo_offer`
(``Orthonym._maybe_append_relative_stereo_offer`` calls it).

    """: append the ``cis``/``trans`` name of a ring pair to ``offers`` as an ``Offer``
    above the systematic floor, IF the primary winner does not already full-RT-pass.

    The best-effort tier ships only a name that OPSIN reads, and OPSIN 2.9.0 reads no
    lowercase ``r``/``s`` (BE-STRICT, ``_final_opsin_validity_gate``), so the name of a ring pair
    that cites them -- ``(1r,4r)-cyclohexane-1,4-diol``, the Blue Book
    "Achiral cyclic compounds") -- is withdrawn there and the molecule is left with the floor's
    ``trans-1,4-dihydroxycyclohexane``. The Blue Book gives the same pair a general name,
    ``trans-cyclohexane-1,4-diol`` "Relative configuration: the stereodescriptors
    'cis' and 'trans'", ``:48155``).

    The names the gate withdrew for this whole molecule are in:func:`withdrawn_names`, in the
    order they were withdrawn; the cascade builds them (the strict path is one source of them,
    not the only one). A withdrawn name is ELIGIBLE when

    * it does not spell a chain or a monocycle by skeletal replacement
      (:func:`names_a_replacement_chain`);
    * the descriptor check (``validation.stereo_descriptors.stereo_block_units``, the check the
      default tier's stereo-layer carve-out applies) accepts it for this input: every lowercase
      block is one it located, at the front of the name or of a prefix, never in the middle of
      the name, and its r/s descriptors are proven right;
    *:func:`convert_pair_blocks` converts every lowercase block (a ring pair that both
      completeness predicates make complete for a relative word) and re-derives the enclosing
      marks; and
    * OPSIN reads a converted name back to the input's full InChIKey (``rt_ok``, which has no
      fail-open branch for a name no gate has seen).

    The first candidate of the first eligible name is appended: ``tier`` systematic_verified (a
    correct name that is not the preferred one), never a PIN. The floor offer stays in the pool,
    so a name that does not read back leaves today's floor name.

    ``rt_ok(name, smiles)`` is the full-InChIKey round-trip predicate of the offer pool
    (``namer._offer_rt_ok``) and ``self01_lookup(name)`` the verdict the coverage audit
    reuses (``namer._self01_lookup``); the caller passes them so that they are resolved in the
    namer module at call time.

    Best-effort ONLY, like the floor: both call sites in ``Orthonym._finish`` sit inside the
    ``_general_fallback_unverified`` guard. Nothing is built when the slot holds no name for this
    input, which is every input without a lowercase r/s block.

    Never raises past the candidate loop -- a failure there must leave ``offers`` as it was."""
